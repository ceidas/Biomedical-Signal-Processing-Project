# Biomedical-Signal-Processing-Project
This project was made as a part of my postgraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering 

Subject: Artifacts and noise removal from three different ECG (Electrocardiography) signals of 30
minutes duration each.

Assignments:

a) Remove artifacts and Noise (for a two channel ECG signal)

b) Eliminate noise and Estimate mean heart rate for every 0.5 secs (for a two channel ECG signal)

c) Eliminate artificial noise (from a one channel ECG)

Software: Matlab, Sublime, Libre Office

Method: Wavelet method

OS: Linux - Ubuntu

===================

How to run:

make sure all files are in the same folder. For each task run the corrensponding code in MATLAB or in Octave.
